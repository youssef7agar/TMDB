### Libraries:
  I used these libraries on such a small project because in real life there is no such a small app and I needed to show what I know<br/>
### Tools:
  Used coroutines that's replaceable with RxJava<br/>
  Used koin that I'd replace with Dagger on bigger prjects because Dagger is a code generation DI not runtime<br/>
  Used retrofit for networking<br/>
### Modularization:
  I would prefer to modularize the code depending on the layer in the clean arch and the feature<br/>
### Size:
  In bigger projects I'd obfuscate the code and shrink it using progaurd<br/>
### Architecture:
  Used MVVM
